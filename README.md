To play, use Z to talk to npcs, press x to attack and press the arrow keys to move.
Keep in  mind that you must be standing still to attack, as you have no need to overexert yourself with things like dash attacks! It's all about precision and planning.
I have the player interact with 5 other entities, The Dog, The Ghost, the Zombie. the Plant. and the Tongue. 
Tips!
While Enemies dont damage to you, getting attacked decreases your score so getting hit still has consequences!
-Enemies only attack when they see you, not when you are close, so it is recommended that you attack from behind, as enemies can inflict knockback and push you out of attack range
-You can only grab 2 out of the 3 items so choose wisely. 
If you want a challenge with a nice reward, go down first, but if you want a slow, casual playthrough, go right.
-I had some playtesters say the flying Enemy is quite tough, given his high health pool and limited back exposure, so try and watch for when he turns around!
-Also turn down your sound alittle b/c the Tongue Enemy's death sound is much louder than the others for some reason.
-Have fun! I hope you enjoy!
-------Patch Notes--------
Hello patient fans! Were back with a new patch for your favorite 2D RPG
--Skull and Flying enemy now have path finding 
These enemies will path find to the player as long as one would think it would notice them. 
---New mechanic---Shadows:
There are now black areas on the redesigned map so you can hide from the sight of enemies, so they cannot track you any longer
They can only attack side to side so use this to your advantage. Since they can only attack from side to side you might be able to stand near them without being hit and go for a stealth kill
